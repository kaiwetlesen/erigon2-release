  <description>
    These services are the recommended set of services which should be open to
    operate a fully functional Erigon2 client. This currently includes all ports
    to operate the peering and snapshot downloader mechanisms, as well as both
    the JSON-RPC and gRPC services. Enable these ports to run Erigon2 in a
    default configuration.

    Note: those operating a public facing Erigon2 node may prefer to proxy or
    otherwise restrict access to the RPC services as running Erigon2 represents
    a considerable investment. For those persons, it is recommended to enable
    the `erigon2-peering` service only and let the RPC services reside behind
    the firewall.
