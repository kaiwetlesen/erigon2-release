# Erigon RPM Spec

This repository houses an RPM spec file for building Erigon, a
very fast Ethereum peer-to-peer client written in GoLang.

See the [Erigon repo](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) for more information.

This packaging of Erigon runs Erigon as its own service user, defaulting
the Erigon data directory into `/var/lib/erigon`, a LSB typical directory.

Also included are a set of SystemD style unit specifications and
a set of default service port definitions to plug into FirewallD.

Configuration options are stored into `/etc/sysconfig/erigon` and
are identical to the command line configuration options that one
would typically use to start Erigon.
